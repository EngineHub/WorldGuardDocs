Build Permissions
=================

An optional feature lets you provide build permissions based on permission nodes. It can be enabled in the :doc:`config`::

    build-permission-nodes:
        enable: true
        deny-message: 

An optional message can be set to change the message that players receive when an action is blocked.

Permissions List
================

* Block place: ``worldguard.build.block.place.<material>``
* Block break: ``worldguard.build.block.remove.<material>``
* Block interact: ``worldguard.build.block.interact.<material>``
* Entity spawn: ``worldguard.build.entity.place.<type>``
* Entity destroy: ``worldguard.build.entity.remove.<type>``
* Entity interact: ``worldguard.build.entity.interact.<type>``
* Entity damage: ``worldguard.build.entity.damage.<type>``
* Item use: ``worldguard.build.item.use.<material>``

The permissions are also checked in the style of ``worldguard.build.block.<material>.<action>``, so ``worldguard.build.block.<material>.place`` would work too.

The list of usable material names comes from the `Material list in Bukkit <https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html>`_. For example, the permission for placing the bed block would be ``worldguard.build.block.place.bed_block``. Be aware that *Material* contains both item and block names.
