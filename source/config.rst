=============
Configuration
=============

Many of WorldGuard's features exist as configuration options (potion blocking, scuba mode with pumpkins, etc.). Every configuration option available is listed on this page.

Configuration Files
===================

Once you have run your server with WorldGuard installed, you will find the main configuration file inside the **plugins/WorldGuard** folder:

* ``config.yml``

Then for every world, you will find per-world configuration files:

* ``worlds/world/config.yml``
* ``worlds/world_nether/config.yml``
* ``worlds/mining_world/config.yml``

If you open up the per-world configuration files, they will be nearly empty. When you wish to override a setting, you would copy it into the world's configuration file.

.. topic:: Example: Making a configuration option per-world

    In the main configuration file, you may have set ``block-creeper-block-damage`` to true::

        mobs:
            block-creeper-explosions: false
            block-creeper-block-damage: true
            block-wither-explosions: false

    But you want to set it to ``false`` in your nether world. Open up ``worlds/world_nether/config.yml`` and replace the file with::

        mobs:
            block-creeper-block-damage: false

    Only the relevant line, as well as any parent sections, needs to be copied over.


Settings
========

.. note::
    These options are presented here as a reference, but you should change a desired option by first finding it in ``config.yml`` because some settings may need to be nested under another setting.

.. csv-table::
    :header: Setting, Default, Description
    :widths: 12, 5, 30

    op-permissions,TRUE,"Whether players with op should be given all permissions for WorldGuard, even if the permissions plugin in use does not provide permission for ops."
    summary-on-start,TRUE,Show summary information about WG's settings for each world on server start. This is pretty noisy and it should be disabled if you have many worlds.
    auto-invincible,FALSE,Give players with the ``worldguard.auto-invincible`` permission invincibility mode on join.
    auto-invincible-group,FALSE,Give players in the ``wg-invincible`` permission group invincibility mode on join.
    auto-no-drowning-group,FALSE,Give players in the ``wg-amphibious`` permission group water breathing mode on join.
    use-player-move-event,TRUE,"Whether WorldGuard should use (a little) more CPU to handle features that require tracking player movement. This must be on to use healing, feeding, greeting, and some other :doc:`regions/flags`."
    use-player-teleports,TRUE,Whether teleport events should be considered when tracking player movement. This should always be on if you are using the player move event and any of the flags that require that.
    host-keys,,A list of hostnames that players must connect from. See :doc:`host-keys`.

    :widths: 12, 5, 30

    block-entity-spawns-with-untraceable-cause,FALSE,"As Bukkit does not always tell plugins the exact reason that an entity was spawned, it may be possible for a player to bypass protection to spawn an entity (such as with a spawn egg). This option blocks cases where the true cause cannot be determined. It is recommended that this option is left off because the number of cases where the cause is not known is quite large."
    interaction-whitelist,[],"A list of block types that should not be protected. For example, if chests were added to this list, then they would never be protected with :doc:`region protection <regions/index>`. This setting is useful primarily when non-vanilla functionality is present (game features added by other plugins or mods) and you don't want it blocked."
    emit-block-use-at-feet,[],"A list of items that, if used, will also require that the player have the permission to *theoretically* modify the block at his or her feet. This setting is useful primarily when there is some item from some plugin or mod that uses a projectile (that affects the world) but does not test permission with WorldGuard. However, this is not a proper solution because the player can still stand in an area where he or she has permission and shoot *into* the desired area."
    ignore-hopper-item-move-events,FALSE,"Disable protections relating to hoppers moving items to and from containers. This can be set to true to slightly improve performance if your server has many hoppers, but be warned that it will allow hoppers outside regions to pull items from inside regions if they are close enough to the border."
    break-hoppers-on-denied-move,TRUE,"If a hopper attempts to pull an item and is denied (as long as the previous config setting is false), WorldGuard will break the hopper block to prevent it from continuously attempting to pull items."

regions.uuid-migration.*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These settings are used to migrate from old versions of WorldGuard and Minecraft. In the past, Minecraft accounts were identified purely by their name, but around the end of Minecraft 1.7, Minecraft moved to a system where players were (internally) identified by "UUIDs" and players *could change their names*. However, all older configuration files still referred to players by their name, so the following settings enable the conversion to UUID on server start for one time (the setting is automatically disabled).

UUID migration can be run repeatedly (with repeated changing of the setting) and it will only convert names that have not yet been converted to UUIDs. If there are no names to convert, then nothing will happen.

.. hint::
    You cannot override these settings per-world.

.. csv-table::
    :header: Setting, Default, Description

    perform-on-next-start,FALSE,"Whether UUID migration should be performed on next server start (once). If the configuration file does not yet have this setting, WorldGuard will assume its value is ``true``, perform the conversion, then set the setting to ``false``."
    keep-names-that-lack-uuids,TRUE,"Sometimes, a name that was added to a region does not actually exist. This option keeps names that can't be converted in the region data so that they can later be removed or re-converted (by adjusting the settings in this section to re-run the conversion)."
