Spatial Queries
===============

WorldGuard optimizes for two types of spatial queries:

* Finding all regions containing a point
* Finding regions overlapping another region

Spatial queries can be performed using an instance of a :doc:`RegionManager <managers>`, but they can also be performed through a special query cache. In either case, a returned ``ApplicableRegionSet`` object will be returned that contains a list of regions, as well as additional methods to perform :doc:`flag-calculation`.

It's also possible to, given a list of regions, to create your own ``ApplicableRegionSet``. This is useful if you want to :doc:`test the value of flags <flag-calculation>` and you have already a list of regions to test with (and the regions do not even need to overlap).

Getting an ApplicableRegionSet
==============================

Through the Query Cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The query cache stores the last query result for at most one or two seconds, which speeds up repeated lookups for the same a block, a common scenario during event handling. However, the query cache only supports the first type of query, point location. To utilize the cache, a new ``RegionQuery`` instance can be obtained from a ``RegionContainer`` (see :doc:`../native-objects` for converting from Bukkit locations):

.. code-block:: java

    RegionQuery query = container.createQuery();
    ApplicableRegionSet set = query.getApplicableRegions(blockVector);

.. topic:: Example: Getting regions at (10, 64, 100)

    .. code-block:: java

        Location loc = new Location(world, 10, 64, 100);
        RegionContainer container = WorldGuard.getInstance().getPlatform().getRegionContainer();
        RegionQuery query = container.createQuery();
        ApplicableRegionSet set = query.getApplicableRegions(loc.toVector().toBlockPoint());

One particular feature of the cache is that it will **return virtual results** if region protection is disabled or region data failed to load:

* If region protection is disabled, an instance of ``PermissiveRegionSet`` will be returned, which will contain no regions and permit any action.
* If region data failed to load, an instance of ``FailedLoadRegionSet`` will be returned, which will contain no regions, deny every action, and also implicitly provide values for some flags (such as ``deny-message`` to inform players of the error).

In either case, ``set.isVirtual()`` will return ``true`` if the result is virtual.

Through a RegionManager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given an `RegionManager`, ``getApplicableRegions(Vector)`` can be used to perform a point location query (see :doc:`../native-objects` for converting from Bukkit locations).

.. code-block:: java

    BlockVector3 position = BlockVector3.at(20, 10, 4);
    ApplicableRegionSet set = regions.getApplicableRegions(position);

.. topic:: Example: Getting regions at (10, 64, 100)

    .. code-block:: java

        Location loc = new Location(world, 10, 64, 100);
        RegionContainer container = WorldGuard.getInstance().getPlatform().getRegionContainer();
        RegionManager regions = container.get(world);
        // Check to make sure that "regions" is not null
        ApplicableRegionSet set = regions.getApplicableRegions(loc.toVector().toBlockPoint());

If the goal is to find a list of regions that overlap another, use ``getApplicableRegions(ProtectedRegion)`` on the manager. Because shape and the region are currently the same objects (coupled together), you have to use a dummy ID:

.. code-block:: java

    BlockVector3 min = BlockVector3.at(0, 0, 0);
    BlockVector3 max = BlockVector3.at(10, 10, 10);
    ProtectedRegion test = new ProtectedCuboidRegion("dummy", min, max);
    ApplicableRegionSet set = regions.getApplicableRegions(test);

Constructing Manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``RegionResultSet`` takes a ``List<ProtectedRegion>`` and an optional global region.

The provided regions do not need to overlap.

.. code-block:: java

    List<ProtectedRegion> regions = Lists.newArrayList();
    regions.add(spawn);
    regions.add(mall);
    regions.add(pub);

    ApplicableRegionSet set = new RegionResultSet(regions, null); // No global region

.. warning::
    Your list of regions may be re-ordered in-place. After you have given a list of regions to the instance, it should no longer be used.

Using a ApplicableRegionSet
===========================

If your interest is in getting the list of regions, ``ApplicableRegionSet`` implements ``Iterable<ProtectedRegion>`` so you can loop over it:

.. code-block:: java

    for (ProtectedRegion region : set) {
        // Do something with each region
    }

.. topic:: Example: Getting a list of regions

    Google's Guava library has ``Lists.newArrayList(Iterable)`` to create an ``ArrayList`` from an ``Iterable``.

    .. code-block:: java

        List<ProtectedRegion> region = Lists.newArrayList(set);

If you are performing a spatial query to check protection or flags, see either :doc:`protection-query` or :doc:`flag-calculation`.
