WorldGuard Documentation
========================

WorldGuard has a host of functions for server owners, server map makers, regular survival servers, and everyone else in between.

* :doc:`Create zones in your world <regions/index>` that only permit mods or certain players from building within
* Set :doc:`additional game rules <config>` on your server (deny wither block damage, falling damage, etc.)
* Set :doc:`game rules on specific areas <regions/flags>` (food regen, health regen, disable PvP, TNT, control mob damage) in your world
* :doc:`Blacklist certain items <blacklist/index>` and blocks so they can't be used
* Dump useful statistics and information about your server (/wg report -p)
* CPU profile your server (/wg profile -p)
* Add :doc:`useful commands <commands>` like an immediate "STOP ALL FIRE SPREAD" command.
* Works, more or less, :doc:`with other plugins and mods <regions/scope>` (other Bukkit plugins and FTB mods)
* Protects :doc:`against many types of abuse <regions/scope>` (tree growth, TNT cannons, piston machines, etc.)
* Certain interactions can also be allowed (door and lever usage, etc.)
* `Open source <https://www.github.com/EngineHub/WorldGuard>`_, and one of the oldest Minecraft projects (older than Bukkit!)
* Enable only features you want! **Everything is off by default.** You can just install WorldGuard and configure it later.
