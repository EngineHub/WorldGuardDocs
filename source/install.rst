Requirements
============

WorldGuard requires a version of the Minecraft server that supports the `Bukkit API <https://dl.bukkit.org/>`_, which includes Spigot and Paper. The "vanilla" Minecraft server cannot run plugins. Other server implementations, such as Forge or Sponge, are also not supported by WorldGuard.

The other requirement is the `WorldEdit <https://www.enginehub.org/worldedit>`_ Bukkit plugin, a very lightweight in-game map editor, also made by us. Please note that you need the Bukkit version of WorldEdit, not another implementation.

Installation
============

WorldGuard can be `downloaded from the Bukkit dev site <https://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/worldguard/>`_.

1. In your server folder, create a "plugins" folder if one does not yet exist.
2. Copy the WorldGuard .jar file into the plugins folder. (Make sure you get WorldEdit as well!)
3. Start your server.

Check your server log for errors. If you encounter errors, see the :doc:`FAQ <faq>` page.
