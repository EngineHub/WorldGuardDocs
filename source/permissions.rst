Permissions
===========

By default, no one can use WorldGuard. In order for yourself, moderators, and players to use WorldGuard, you must provide the proper permissions. One way is to provide op to moderators and administrators (unless disabled in the :doc:`configuration <config>`), but providing the permission nodes on this page (through a permissions plugin) is the more flexible.

You can give the ``worldguard.*`` permission to give yourself and other administrators full access to WorldGuard.

    worldguard.notify,"Receive notification with the 'notify' :doc:`blacklist <blacklist/index>` action and the 'notify' :doc:`region flags <regions/flags>`."
    worldguard.region.bypass.<world>,"Bypass region protection for a given world, except for PvP deny flags."
    worldguard.region.toggle-bypass,"Allows using the ``/rg bypass`` command to toggle the above behavior (still requires the bypass permission)."
    worldguard.chest-protection.override,"Bypass :doc:`chest-protection` and open protected chests."

.. warning::
    If you are op or have all permissions, you will implicitly have these protection bypass permissions and it will appear that protection does not work.

Commands
========

See the :doc:`commands` page for an explanation of some of these commands.

    worldguard.god,"Be able to use ``/god`` (and ``/ungod``)."
    worldguard.god.other,"Be able to use ``/god`` (and ``/ungod``) on others."

Per-Region Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following commands support a base permission (such as ``worldguard.region.redefine``), but also allow you to use specific permissions that only apply if a player is an owner or member of a region:

* ``worldguard.region.redefine.own.<region name>``
* ``worldguard.region.redefine.member.<region name>``
* ``worldguard.region.redefine.<region name>``

Permissions systems that support wildcard permissions can be used to grant permissions to all regions in any given category, e.g.:

* ``worldguard.region.redefine.own.*``

.. csv-table::
    :header: Permission, Explanation
    :widths: 15, 25

    worldguard.region.redefine.*,"Be able to use  ``/rg redefine``."
    worldguard.region.remove.*,"Be able to use  ``/rg remove``."
    worldguard.region.setpriority.*,"Be able to use  ``/rg setpriority``."
    worldguard.region.setparent.*,"Be able to use  ``/rg setparent``."
    worldguard.region.select.*,"Be able to use  ``/rg select``."
    worldguard.region.info.*,"Be able to use  ``/rg info`` and ``/rg flags``."
    worldguard.region.teleport.*,"Be able to use  ``/rg teleport``."
    worldguard.region.addmember.*,"Be able to use  ``/rg addmember``."
    worldguard.region.addowner.*,"Be able to use  ``/rg addowner``."
    worldguard.region.removemember.*,"Be able to use  ``/rg removemember``."
    worldguard.region.removeowner.*,"Be able to use  ``/rg removeowner``."

.. topic:: Example: Letting players look up information on only regions that they own
    
    Use the own.* form of the permission::

        worldguard.region.info.own.*
    
.. topic:: Example: Allowing every player to use ``/rg teleport city``

    The region name can be specified in the permission::

        worldguard.region.teleport.city.*

Flag Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``/rg flag`` command has the basic permission::

    worldguard.region.flag.*

However, rather than providing that encompassing permission, you can provide the combination of the following two:

* To determine *which regions* can have their flag changed by the player, any of the following permissions can be given (and they work like the permissions in the previous section):

    * ``worldguard.region.flag.regions.own.<region name>``
    * ``worldguard.region.flag.regions.member.<region name>``
    * ``worldguard.region.flag.regions.<region name>``

* However, to determine *which types of flags* can be set by the player, permissions of the following pattern can be given:

    * ``worldguard.region.flag.flags.<flag name>.<region name>.<flag value>``

.. topic:: Example: Letting players be able to only change flags on regions that they own, and limit the flags that they can change to ``use`` and ``chest-access``

    You would need to provide the following permissions::

        worldguard.region.flag.regions.own.*
        worldguard.region.flag.flags.use.*
        worldguard.region.flag.flags.chest-access.*
