Region Flags
============

Regions can have flags set upon it. Some uses of flags include:

* Blocking player versus player combat with the ``pvp`` flag
* Denying entry to a region using the ``entry`` flag
* Disabling the melting of snow using the ``snow-melt`` flag
* Blocking players within the region from receiving chat using the ``receive-chat`` flag
* Halting the growth of vines by using the ``vine-growth`` flag

A region can have several different flags set at one time, although a certain flag can only have one value at a time. Flags are defined using the ``/region flag`` (alternatively ``/rg flag``) command, as illustrated below for the "spawn" region and "hospital" regions::

    /region flag spawn pvp deny
    /region flag spawn greeting Welcome to spawn!
    /rg flag hospital heal-amount 2
    /rg flag hospital heal-delay 1

Remove a flag by not specifying a value::

    /rg flag spawn pvp

List flags by using the "flags" command::

    /rg flags spawn

The output of this command is interactive in-game. Click flag values to change them, and the arrows at the bottom to navigate through pages.

Region Groups
=============

Sometimes, it may be desired for a flag to only apply to a certain group of players rather than everyone that should enter the region. This can be achieved by specifying an additional "region group" when defining the flag.

Region groups describe the (non-)membership of players to a region. They are handled by WorldGuard internally, and are entirely unrelated to permission groups.

The following region groups exist:

.. csv-table::
    :header: Region Group, Description
    :widths: 5, 20

    all,Everyone
    members,Members and owners of the region
    owners,Owners of the region
    nonmembers,Everyone who `isn't` an owner or member of the region
    nonowners,Everyone who `isn't` an owner of the region

The group can be specified using the ``-g`` marker as illustrated below::

    /region flag spawn -g nonmembers pvp deny

It is **not** possible to set the same flag to different values for more than one group on the same region. If you need that functionality, consider making several regions.

.. note::
    When there are multiple overlapping regions, a player must be a member of the region *on which the flag is set* or *on one of the region's child regions* (when region inheritance is involved). This is explained further in :doc:`priorities`.

.. tip::
    The ``entry`` and ``exit`` flags default to "non-member", meaning setting them to "deny" will prevent non-members from entering/exiting the region. The ``spawn`` location flag defaults to "members", which means that only members can take advantage of it by default. The ``nonplayer-protection-domains`` flag has no region group. All other flags provided by WorldGuard default to "everyone".

Types of Flags
==============

Each flag is of a certain type that determines what kind of values it may take. For example, the ``heal-amount`` flag is an integer flag, so you can only set integer values for it.

.. csv-table::
    :header: Type, Kind of values
    :widths: 5, 30

    state, "Either 'allow' or 'deny' (explained later)"
    string, "Any form of text"
    integer, "A number that does not have decimals (5, but not 5.5)"
    double, "Numbers that may have decimals (5, 5.5, 2.425)"
    location, "A location in a world"
    boolean, "True or false"
    set, "A list of unique entries"

Internally, there are more types, but it should generally not be of concern.

.. tip::
    Most string flags will accept ``\n`` as a newline (for example, to send multiple lines via ``greeting``/``farewell``, or a title and subtitle via ``greeting-title`` and ``farewell-title``).

    They may also accept color codes, either in the old style ``&[0-9a-f]`` or ```[RrYyGgCcBbPp012w]`` for dark-red, red, dark yellow, yellow, etc., and ``[&`][klmnox]`` for obfuscated, bold, strikethrough, underline, and italic text.

    They may also accept some replacements, such as ``%name%`` for the player's name, ``%world%`` for world name, ``%online%`` for player count, ``%id%`` for the player's UUID, and ``%health%`` for the player's current health.

.. topic:: Example: Using string formatting options

    Setting spawn's ``greeting-title`` to a fancy welcome message::

        /rg flag spawn greeting-title `bWelcome to spawn!\n`YEnjoy your stay in `g`n%world%`x, `C%name%`Y!

Conflicting Flags
=================

Sometimes, a certain location may have multiple overlapping regions with different values for the same flag. The following rules are used to determine which values are selected:

* Regions will inherit the value of a flag from its parent, **if** the region did not have the flag set. (Note that the ``build`` flag is set implicitly with membership.)
* Higher priority regions will override lower-priority regions.
* The global region is considered like any other region, except it is at the lowest possible priority.

However, it is still possible for there to be conflicting flag values even after that process. Imagine two different regions at the same priority, for example. At that point, the value of the flag is decided differently depending on the type of flag:

* For state flags, if ``deny`` is present, the result is ``deny``. Otherwise, if ``allow`` is present, then the final value is ``allow``.
* For other flags, the result is not defined. For that reason, do not, for example, set two different greeting messages in the same area with the same priority.

Default Values of Flags
=======================

Flags can have default values, which are used if a flag is not set for the subject's region group on any region that affects the action. The default behavior is whichever is most sensible. For example, if ``item-pickup`` is not defined, WorldGuard defaults to allowing it. You can view the default values ingame by using the "flags" command as already described above. State flags can either be allowed by default, or have no default value. A rule of thumb is that protection-related flags, as listed below, have no default value, except for the ``build`` flag. All other state flags are usually allowed by default. The ``build`` flag is special. Its default value depends on the region membership of the subject and it's always set implicitely, if it's not set explicitely on any highest priority region that affects an action. That's the reason why members and owners can build and non-members can't by default. All other protection-related flags are always checked in tandem with the build flag. Thus their default behavior is the resulting value of the build flag.

.. tip::
    Most of the time you don't need to set any flags. You should only set flags if you want to deviate from the default values or to overwrite set flags of other regions. Specifically don't set protection-related flags to completely protect or unprotect a region. Use membership or the ``passthrough`` flag instead.

Flag Listing
============

Flags are broken down into categories below.

.. _flag-overrides:

Overrides
~~~~~~~~~

.. csv-table::
    :header: Flag, Type, description
    :widths: 10, 5, 30

    passthrough,state,"This flag is short for 'passthrough build'. It has nothing to do with movement.

    * If not set **(default)**, then the region protects it area.
    * If set to ``deny``, then the region protects its area.
    * If set to ``allow``, then the region **no longer** protects its area.

    Where does the flag come into use?

    * When you are using other flags (PvP, healing, etc.) and you don't want to prevent building.
    * Why not set ``build`` to ``allow`` (explained later) instead? That would override other regions and let people build!"
    nonplayer-protection-domains,set of strings,"Non-player associables, such as pistons, are usually members of either all regions in which they are in or only of the regions with the highest priorities in which they are in, depending on the ``use-max-priority-association`` :doc:`../config` setting and if it is a :doc:`global-region`. Thus there can be borders between regions, such that pistons cannot move blocks from one region into another region.

    The borders between the regions can be removed for non-player associables by setting the ``nonplayer-protection-domains`` flags of these regions. This flag is a set of strings, describing the domains to which the region belongs. If a non-player associable is a member of a region, then it is also a member of another region, if there is at least one domain to which both regions belong to."

Protection-Related

    * etc."
    interact,state,"Everything that involves 'using' a block or entity:

    firework-damage,state,Whether fireworks can deal damage to entities
    use-anvil,state,Whether anvils can be used
    use-dripleaf,state,Whether dripleaf can be used

.. warning::
    None of these flags are player-specific. For example, the ``block-break`` flag, if set to deny, **prevents pistons from breaking blocks**.

    To understand why, consider the fact that players can fling TNT into a region from outside, or a player can build an inchworm piston machine that moves into another region. While these actions were caused by a player, realistically attempting to figure which player built the TNT cannon or used it is much more difficult. However, you still want to prevent someone from blowing up spawn with a TNT cannon.

    Outright blocking TNT cannons or pistons is the wrong solution. Pistons and TNT cannons should be allowed in *some* cases. For example, a TNT cannon or piston inside should work *within* the region.

    First off, remember who can build in regions: it's **not** players, it's **members**. When we consider pistons or TNT, it should be no different. How does WorldGuard figure out whether a piston machine or TNT cannon is a member of a region? **If it's inside the region,** of course!

    When you create a region, before setting any flags on it:

    * Members may build
    * Non-members may **not** build

    TNT cannons and pistons inside are allowed to work because they are "members." An imaginary player, "Bobby," who isn't a member yet, is unable to place or break blocks. Once you add Bobby to the region, then Bobby can build.

    When you set the protection flags, you override this behavior. If you set ``block-break`` to ``deny``, then even members are unable to break blocks. Bobby cannot break blocks. A TNT cannon inside cannot break blocks. A piston inside cannot break blocks. **You break pistons.**

    That raises two questions:

    * **How do I prevent players from placing or breaking blocks?** Don't do anything. Don't change any flags! Remember, only members can build by default.
    * **How do I change a flag to only affect players?** You probably mean: how do you make a flag only affect *non-members*? Well, that's easy: use :ref:`region-groups`.

.. tip::
    Note: If the ``build`` flag is set to ``allow`` or ``deny``, it can still be overriden with a different flag (``block-break``, ``interact``, etc.). The ``build`` flag is set implicitly with membership.

    soil-dry,state,Whether soil will dry
    coral-fade,state,Whether coral will die when not in water
    copper-fade,state,Whether copper will fade

.. warning::
    The ``fire-spread``, ``water-flow``, ``lava-flow`` and ``lava-fire`` flags require that the "high frequency flags" option be enabled in the :doc:`configuration <../config>`. This is because these events can be very frequent, requiring more region lookups, and potentially slowing down your server (or at least warming the server room a bit more).

Movement
~~~~~~~~

.. csv-table::
    :header: Flag, Type, description
    :widths: 10, 5, 30

    entry,state,Whether players (by default non-members) can enter the region

    spawn,location,The location to spawn or teleport to when a player (by default member) dies within the region
    teleport-message,string,The message issued to players that are teleported with ``/region teleport``

.. tip::
    As mentioned above, the ``spawn`` location flag defaults to "members", which means that only members can take advantage of it by default. Set the region group for the flag to change this.

.. tip::
    If overlapping regions have the same ``greeting`` or ``farewell`` flag, no message is sent when moving between these regions, e.g. if you enter one region while being in the other. This is also true, in a more general sense, of any player movement that does *not* result in the flag at the "from" and "to" locations changing.

.. warning::
    The ``greeting`` and ``farewell`` message flags require that the "use player move event" option **not** be disabled in the :doc:`configuration <../config>`.

.. topic:: Example: Preventing non-members of a "secret_club" region from entering it
    
    Since entry defaults to "nonmembers", you don't need to explicitly set it here::
